# ffxi-gearswaps
Tristamgreen's FFXI Gearswaps.  Free for use.  These files are optimized for use on the Supernova Private Server.
To use these files with Gearswap:
1.  Copy the file common_gs_functions.lua to the \windower4\addons\gearswap\data folder.  This file is required for common gearswap functions,
and its functionality will be expanding in the future.
2.  Copy the desired job file "Tristamgreen_JOB.lua" to the same folder.  Rename the file to your character name.
3.  Start FFXI with Gearswap enabled.  You should get a console message that reads "CHARNAME_JOB.lua loaded!"
You can verify gear you are missing by way of the command //gs validate.  The main screen text will read out any items that are not in accessible inventories.
